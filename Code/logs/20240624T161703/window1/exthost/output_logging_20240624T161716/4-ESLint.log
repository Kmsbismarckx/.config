Failed to load the ESLint library for the document /home/bismarckx/Projects/vue/src/main.js

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder vue
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder vue by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.
